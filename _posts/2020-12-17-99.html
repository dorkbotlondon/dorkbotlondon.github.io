<b>DORKMAS 2020!</b>

Another year, another Dorkmas! It's cold and strange outside, so come and gather
in the virtual warmth of an online Dorkbot (link to follow).

Free entry, no registration required. Talks start 7.30pm. We'll be running an
accompanying chat and social in the <a href="https://dorkbotlondon.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-eozeft0y-mW~bELYuSn5mbztV1UO3GA#/">Dorkbot London Slack.</a>

Don't forget to <a href="http://dorkbotlondon.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c64ae7bbb8eb1249be8ca8fa6&id=e2a9f9039c">join our mailing list</a>, and <a href='https://twitter.com/DorkbotLondon'>follow us on Twitter</a>.


With short talks from...

<b>==== Air Giants ====</b>

Air Giants are building a new kind of giant soft robot, huge joyful creatures
made of little more than air, light, and fabric. Great big wiggly robots, for
people to interact with, intended for festivals and every kind of creative fun.

They'll talk about what soft robots are, how the team got here, how the robots
work, and what they plan to do with them next.

They're also very interested in finding new collaborations and outlets for the
Giants, so please bring your ideas to the Slack channel.

<b>==== Julie Freeman ====</b>

"ALICE in microbe land
or Why we should all be taking the piss to save the planet."

Julie will talk about her latest data art project Active Living Infrastructure:
Controlled Environment (ALICE) which aims to create a live digital interface
between microbes and humans.

Working with Bristol Robotics Lab, and Newcastle University's Experimental
Architecture team, ALICE is concerned with how can we build an interface to
integrate urine consuming electricity producing microbes into our homes.
Pee Power FTW.

<b>==== Alex Zivanovic ====</b>

"The Senster – an interactive robotic sculpture from 50 years ago"

Alex will talk about the Senster, what it did, how it did it and the lessons
can we learn from it.

He’ll also update us on its recent resurrection to working order.
