<section>
    <article>
        <p>
            We are slowly getting towards Dorkbot 100, shaving 1/2 the distance off between 99 and a full century each time. 
            Come along and listen to people Doing Strange Things With Electricity (isn't <i>everything</i> 
            electric, when you think about it?)
        </p>
        <p>
            Free entry, no registration required. Talks start at 7:00pm, doors from 6:45pm.

        <h3><b>==== Studio Playfool ====</b></h3>
    
        <p>
            Playfool is an art-design unit by Daniel Coppen (UK) and Saki Maruyama (JP). Through the medium of play, their practice
            explores notions of agency in relation to technology, embracing the tension between the material and immaterial.
            Understanding play as a form of epistemological inquiry, their work highlights society's entanglement with technology,
            often taking the form of spatial installations, interactive devices and digital games.</p>
            <p>
            Playfool's works have been awarded in both the Dezeen Award (2021) and STARTS Prize (2024), and have been exhibited at
            the Victoria and Albert Museum (London, 2023), Ars Electronica (Linz, 2024), and the Powerhouse Museum (Sydney, 2025).

        <h3><b>==== Astryd Park ====</b></h3>
    
        <p>
    Astryd Park is an artist, creative technologist, and Quantum Application Engineer at Moth - who has been creating
    artistic applications of quantum computing since 2020. Astryd's interest is building systems/applications/solutions
    which bring creative side of cutting-edge technologies. For example, she is the creator of the Moth's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01442">Quantum Brush</a> application, which bridges quantum computing with visual media, and which is alsoshowcased in Berlin Science Week. During their MSc in Creative Computing at the UAL Creative Computing Institute, they
    explored the intersection of physical computing and quantum computing, bringing post-humanist ideas to life through the
    installation <b>'Wie?: A Question from the Quantum Realm'</b>, which is showcased in CCI Winter Festival in Peckham, London.
    Most recently, they showcased their artwork 'Reality is Not What it Seems' at London Tech Week—the UK's largest tech
    event, and Quantum After Dark in Science Gallery, greeting more than 700 people. The project uses a custom quantum 2D
    image encoding algorithm (QPIXL) to distort live video recordings, challenging perceptions of digital reality. Their
    creative practice spans moving image, kinetic sculpture, science fiction, graphic novels, and cinema music.

        <h3><b>==== Katiushka Borges ====</b></h3>
        
        <p>
            Kat's last project ANCESTRAL HEARTBEAT is a multisensory interactive installation about the oral
            tradition of Mexican elders to inspire new generations to value the wisdom of Ancestors. (The solution of using an Arduino
            Touchboard was through a dorkbot presentation 10 years ago.) Kat was awarded a residency in Mexico to develop this project and
            has exhibited it in London and in 2 museums in Mexico. Most recently, in April 2025 she was invited by Harvard Divinity School to present
            at Spirituality &amp; the Arts Conference.

    <h3><b>==== Location: <a href="https://www.thesekforde.com/"> The Sekforde</a> ====</b></h3>
    
    <p><em>
        NB: Unfortunately Upstairs at The Sekforde is not wheelchair accessible
        as there are stairs up to the room.
    </em></p>
    
    <h4>
        == By Tube: ==
    </h4>
    
    <p>
        For anyone on the Elizabeth Line we recommend travelling to Farringdon
        and using its Barbican exit (not the Farringdon exit). It will spit you out
        right next to Charterhouse Square (either on Lindsey Street or Hayne Street) ,
        both of which lead onto the Square which is lit almost entirely with gas lamps.
        The exact opposite of electricity!
    </p>
    
    <p>    
        If you are coming to Farringdon via rail or tube you can also walk all
        the way through (within the station) to the Elizabeth Line exit but you may be
        charged more if touching in on tube/rail and touching out on Elizabeth.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
        == By Bus: ==
    </h4>
    <p>The 153 bus runs along nearby St John Street. The nearest stops are -
        Aylesbury Street, #54246 or Percival Street (Stop UJ), #55543 (heading
        towards Finsbury Park) St. John Street Clerkenwell Rd, #53751 (heading towards
        Liverpool Street)
    </p>
    <p>The 55 and 253 buses also serve Clerkenwell Road.</p>
    
    <h4>Or just use CityMapper or whatever...</h4>
